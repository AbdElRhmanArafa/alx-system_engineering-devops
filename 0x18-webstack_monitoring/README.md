## Task 1 
-   sign up in datadaog in free tier (us-1 region)
-   open server (web-01) using ssh
-   install datadog agent
-   get API and application key save into your profile
  

### Notes :
     Datadog API Key: This key is used to interact with the Datadog API. It allows you to submit data, such as logs, metrics, and events, or to query Datadog to retrieve data. Essentially, it's used for operations that modify or input data into your Datadog account. Each API key is unique to the Datadog account and should be kept secure as it allows significant access to the account.

    Datadog Application Key: This key is used in conjunction with the API key to interact with Datadog APIs that require more specific permissions. While the API key can be seen as a way to authenticate to the platform, the application key is used to authorize access to specific functions within the account (like accessing certain data or managing parts of the account). This helps in scenarios where you might need to give a service or a team member access to a specific part of Datadog without exposing full account access.
